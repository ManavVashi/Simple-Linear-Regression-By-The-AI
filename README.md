# Simple-Linear-Regression-by-The-AI

* In this repository I attach my work done with one of the Machine Learning Algorithms called Linear Regression. I make it as simple as I can. I include Applied Linear Regression as well as a research approach in which I         define my own Linear Regression class. I included sufficient theoretical knowledge within the notebook also.
